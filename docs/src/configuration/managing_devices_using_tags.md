# Managing Devices using Tags

Tags are a powerful way to manage your devices in Thymis.
You can use tags to group devices together, filter devices based on specific criteria, and perform actions on multiple devices at once.

## Adding Tags to a Device

To add tags to a device, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Thymis-Controller web interface.
2. Click on the "Devices" tab.
3. Add tags to a device using the UI-Elements in the `Tags` column.

## Managing Tags

You can assign and configure modules for your Tags in the same way you would for individual devices.
