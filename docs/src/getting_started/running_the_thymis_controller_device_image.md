# Running the Thymis-Controller Device Image

Once you have created, downloaded, and flashed the Thymis-Controller device image to an SD card/USB drive/Bootable disk, you can run it on your machine.

Follow your device's instructions to boot from the SD card/USB drive/Bootable disk.

Once the device has booted, you will see a screen that looks like this:

You can connect to the Thymis-Controller using the address shown on the screen, using the credentials that you set when you created the device image.

Once you have connected to the Thymis-Controller, you can start generating, deploying, and managing your IoT devices.
